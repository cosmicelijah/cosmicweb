            Hello, it's CosmicElijah, its nice to meet you, but its even better to
            meet me. My name is Elijah, I have 290 hours with Java in total, and
            I specialize in sticking it straight up the fucking cooter. Java is
            a way of life for me, I go in there, I bend them over, I open their
            cheeks nice and wide, I get a clear view of the colon, prostate, and
            coccyx, and I knuckle fuck them all the way up to the palm right up
            the butt cunt so they feel a burning sensation deep in the ass pussy
            like IcyHot. Java is a way of life for me, I never change my
            language, fuck you. If at any point during my project you ask me to
            change languages, I gladly suggest you go fuck yourself. I follow
            absolutely no type of development team. If you wanna give managers, give
            them to others, don't you dare bring that shit to me. All I know how
            to do is go in there, get a lot of poopoo on my peter, and a lot of
            shit on my dick, from sticking it straight up their ass. Now let's
            go team.
