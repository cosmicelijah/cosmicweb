            Hello, it's CosmicElijah, its nice to meet you, but its even better
            to meet me. My name is Elijah Watson, I have 290 hours with Java in total,
            and I specialize in sticking it straight up the fucking culo.
            Java is a way of life for me, I go in there, I bend them over, I
            open their cheeks nice and wide, I get a clear view of the colon,
            prostate, and coccyx, and I knuckle fuck them all the way up to the
            palm right up the butt cunt so they feel a burning sensation deep in
            the ass pussy like IcyHot. Java is a way of life for me, I never
            change my language, fuck you. If at any point during my project you
            ask me to change languages, I gladly suggest you go fuck yourself. I
            follow absolutely no type of development team. If you wanna give
            managers, give them to others, don't you dare bring that shit to me.
            All I know how to do is go in there, get a lot of poopoo on my
            peter, and a lot of shit on my dick, from sticking it straight up
            their ass. Now let's go team.
